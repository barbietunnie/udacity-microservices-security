1. Incident commander name:

Monero crypto mining container

2. Executive Summary of what happened:

The CPU utilization doubled from an average of 34% to about 70%, and some abnormalities were detected on the falco-exporter where the mount launched in a priviledged container and the event rate had multiple spikes of high proportions.

3. Summary of what was affected:

Unexpected spike in resource usage which led to an increase in latency of the cluster response, and the system resources were being utilized by illegal actors thereby bringing about timeouts.

4. Summmry of the impact:

The crypto-miner was consuming a huge amount of CPU thereby slowly bringing the system to a halt, and suspicious services running in the cluster fighting for system resource with legitimate services.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:

- Harden cluster using baseline hardening at least
- Perform a vulnerability scan of the libraries and docker images in use using static and dynamic analysis, and resolve any vulnerabilities discovered
- Immediate removal of suspicious or unrecognized services within the cluster/node.

6. Summary of lessons learned:

Carrying out process monitoring at runtime is vital to detect suspicious processes running in a pod within the Kubernetes cluster, and allows for real-time threat detection. Putting a tool like Falco to use provides alerts on a variety of security events such as priviledge escalation, namesapce changes and execution of sensitive services/utilties.

It is good practice to harden the different components within a kubernetes cluster (control plane, etcd, kubelet etc), as the default kubernetes installation is so secure.
